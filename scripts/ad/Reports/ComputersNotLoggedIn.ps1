# This PowerShell script retrieves information about user accounts in an Active Directory domain.
# It separates users into two categories based on their login activity over the past 90 days: those who haven't logged in and those who have. 
# The script specifies the OU path and export path for the resulting data. 
# It uses the Get-ADComputer cmdlet to filter and retrieve user information, including samaccountname, Name, and LastLogonDate properties. 
# The data is sorted by LastLogonDate and exported to a CSV file. This script helps administrators identify inactive users and manage their accounts effectively.

# Use -90 for who hasnâ€™t logged in over the past 90 days
# Use 90 for who has logged in over the past 90 days
