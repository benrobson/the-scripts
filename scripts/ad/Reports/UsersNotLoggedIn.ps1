# This script defines a function that retrieves user information from an Active Directory domain based on their login activity.
# It filters and selects enabled users who haven't logged in over the past 90 days within a specified organizational unit. 
# The resulting user information, including their username, name, and last login date, is sorted and exported to a CSV file. 
# This function is useful for identifying inactive user accounts within a specific organizational unit.

# Use -90 for who hasnâ€™t logged in over the past 90 days
# Use 90 for who has logged in over the past 90 days
