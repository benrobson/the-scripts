# This script exports user information from an Active Directory domain, including the user's name, username, email address, status, and groups they belong to. 
# It retrieves all user objects and iterates over them, collecting group membership details for each user. 
# The script then creates custom objects for each user, adding the relevant properties, and appends them to an array. 
# Finally, it sorts and displays the report on the screen and exports it to a CSV file. 
# This script is useful for generating a comprehensive user report for analysis or documentation purposes.

# Export the Users Name, Username, Email Address, Status, and Groups the user is in.
